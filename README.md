Persistent BTree Implementation
===============================

This was a project I did for CS back in college. It's a simple persistent btree implementation in Java that holds Strings. The other code in here was used as part of the project to hit NIS and get the accounts on the CS servers as data to test the BTree.

Please note that much of this code was written while drinking a lot of caffeine so it probably should be refactored and cleaned up.
